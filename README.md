## Description
This project solves the challenge for Module 19 with Cypress. It contains a "component test"  for the "quiz.tsx" component and an "end-to-end test" (E2E) for the whole application.

## Usage
1. On a terminal run the command:
   
     npm run start:dev

2. While keeping the previous terminal running, open another terminal and execute the command:

    npm run test
   
4. Both the component and E2E tests will be excecuted and show the corresponding results.
